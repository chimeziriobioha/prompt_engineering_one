I tried prompt engineering with Python and OpenAI API for the first time today.

Used it to genarte HTML and CSS code for a dropdown button with 3 links, returned as JSON. Also generated some welcome note.

I ran the code 3 times with the same settings and got 3 different results (in `/responses` folder) with increasing degrees of accuracy and finishing touches. The script also extracts the actual formatted code into `/dropdowns` folder.

It's quite interesting and fulfilling! I'll definitely pay more attention moving forward.
